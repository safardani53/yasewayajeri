no matter what stood in their way.</p><p>At the same time, some of these couples should probably not have married. Not based on what we all watched.</p><p>But all of the couples gave us some spectacular wedding photos. Let’s take a look!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Ariela Weinberg and Biniyam Shibre starred on two seasons of 90 Day Fiance: The Other Way.</p><p>Then, they made their way over to the United States — and onto Season 9 of 90 Day Fiance.</p><p>They had a child, and intercontinental move, and countless fights before finally tying the knot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>By his own admission, Bini was “not happy” about the Jewish wedding ceremony.</p><p>Though the wedding incorporated his Ethiopian heritage, he is an Ethiopian Orthodox Christian.</p><p>Ariela has participated in many of his religious festivals and rituals as a compromise. This reciprocation was a first for him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The wedding was gorgeous, though.</p><p>90 Day Fiance fans had already seen spoilers about this last year, when photos from the nuptials leaked.</p><p>Seeing it was another matter. Really a beautiful ceremony … no matter how you feel about their relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Bilal Hazziez and Shaeeda Sween were already spiritually married before they began filming.</p><p>However, their formal wedding — the one presumably attached to a marriage license — took place in Bilal’s home.</p><p>His sister, Nefertari, did a fantastic job of decorating Bilal’s spacious, colorless home into a dazzling venue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Shaeeda and Bilal did not have a “you may kiss the bride” moment. Of course, that is not part of Muslim wedding tradition.</p><p>They did immediate foreshadow conflicts to come. Shaeeda still hopes to have children. Bilal will likely stall as long as he can.</p><p>But for now, we can admire how stunning she looks in that dress. Pranks aside, Nefertari did a stellar job.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Emily Bieberly and Kobe Blaise had a fight the night before the wedding, but made up.</p><p>Was it for the best that they made up and got married? Well … maybe the future will surprise us.</p><p>But they had an indoor wedding, with Emily still hiding her pregnancy and both her and Kobe looking great.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Kobe and Emily and both of Emily’s parents were very emotional on the day of the wedding.</p><p>Those tearful moments showed how significant this day was.</p><p>Of course, a couple of days later, Emily and Kobe revealed that they were expecting Baby #2.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Jibri Bell and Miona Bell did not always demonstrate the best judgment during their season.</p><p>But Miona had a strong vision of what she wanted her wedding to be.</p><p>Eventually, they compromised on an attainable wedding. Sadly, the plans came too late for Jibri’s parents to be able to attend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>One of their biggest worries was the “arch” that their friend, Igor, was driving to Joshua Tree from Los Angeles.</p><p>When it arrived, it was not really a traditional arch. It was just two thirds of a triangle.</p><p>Despite her strong vision for what she wanted her wedding to be, Miona accepted it for what it was.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Jibri’s grandmother did a fantastic job of officiating the wedding.</p><p>While viewers have mixed feelings about their vows, the sand symbolism was a cute and setting-appropriate touch.</p><p>And even people who hate Jibri’s band’s normal music were charmed by his country song. (That said, I prefer his band’s music)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Kara Bass and Guillermo Rojer were, in many practical ways, married during her time in the DR.</p><p>However, living together in Virginia showed Guillermo that Kara is a little set in her ways.</p><p>In a place where she’s accustomed to making her own choices, it was hard for her to back off — and cut back on partying.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>But the two were one of the better-liked couples this season, and not only because of their castmates.</p><p>They really love each other. And their problems with communications are not unassailable.</p><p>Also? They both looked drop-dead gorgeous on their wedding day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>They had a larger ceremony, and were glad that they did.</p><p>Fans cannot stop talking about how much they loved Kara’s perfect, perfect hair that day.</p><p>Guillermo’s hair has looked better (it looked best in his throwback pics in the Dominican Republic), but he was as handsome as ever.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Patrick Mendes and Thais Ramone had three major hurdles in their relationship.</p><p>His family was one. Patrick’s control issues, making unilateral decisions, was another. Her dad was another.</p><p>They didn’t actually solve any of these problems before getting married.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Of course, maybe they didn’t really have to.</p><p>Patrick’s issues are one thing. The rest is just other people’s opinions, related or otherwise. Background noise.</p><p>In Florida, Patrick and Thais were joined by friends and family for a beautiful outdoor ceremony.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Words cannot express how insanely dazzling Thais looked in her wedding gown.</p><p>It’s no surprise that one of the hottest couples in the franchise’s history also looked this fantastic on their wedding day.</p><p>Truly, we are rooting for their marriage. And for John’s housing search.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Yvette Arellano and Mohamed Abdelhamed were sure to include her son, Tharan, in their wedding.</p><p>It was not Mohamed’s “dream” wedding. That would have been a quick and efficient courthouse wedding.</p><p>Instead, they married at an actual venue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Despite the delay to his precious green card documentation, Mohamed eventually accepted that.</p><p>They were also both open to Tharan changing out of his (let’s face it, miserably uncomfortable) formal attire.</p><p>We’d say that it was a beautiful ceremony like the others, but viewers felt distracted during the on-screen nuptials.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Days before the wedding episode (yet months after the wedding date), Mohamed’s alleged texts leaked.</p><p>In the very believable text messages, he insulted Yve, he insulted Tharan, and he was cheating. He made it clear that he wanted to leave Yvette as soon as he has his green card.</p><p>Perhaps Yve can say more on Instagram after the Tell All airs. For now, we only have these bittersweet pics.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WFcIWPZpuasV2btqK6wp5ksJ2Umbavs9Jmqp6dXZa5rXnOn2StoJViwKat0qilZnFdmLy2vMueqmg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./sister-wives-gwendlyn-brown-details-breast-reduction-surgery.html>&#171;&nbsp;Sister Wives Gwendlyn Brown Details Breast Reduction Surgery</a>
