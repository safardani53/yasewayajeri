The disease-stricken reality star came out guns blazing during the Tuesday, February 16, episode of <i>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</i>&nbsp;</span><span>— mostly because she looked up the definition of Munchausen syndrome (or as she calls it, “Hauschen-Mauchen”) and was not thrilled. Meanwhile, <b>Lisa Rinna</b> had to deal with Yolanda screaming at her, plus ongoing drama with <b>Kim Richards</b>, who she described as a “f–king lunatic.”</span></p><p><span>P.S. </span><b>Erika Girardi</b><span>’s husband came out to play during this episode, and told </span><b>Lisa Vanderpump</b><span> that she reminds him of an alligator. New favorite cast member alert!</span></p><p><b>Yolanda Says Lisa Rinna Is Bipolar</b></p><p>Here’s the good news: Erika finally admitted that she ratted out Lisa Vanderpump for talking about Yolanda’s kids. “We went to the beach, she said ‘How did <b>Kyle</b>’s dinner party go?’ I said, ‘Kyle and Lisa were talking,'” Erika explained at lunch with her friends. “You were talking about <b>Mohamed</b> with Kyle.”</p><p><span>Glad that’s cleared up — but the bad (by which we mean *dramatic*) news? Yolanda looked up “Munchausen,” and was more furious than ever with Lisa Rinna. The former model told Kyle Richards that her behavior was “shocking” on the way to Erika’s party, while </span><b>Eileen Davidson</b><span> and Rinna chatted about Yolanda in a different car. “She said that because of your behavior with the Kim thing, she could have put it out there that you were bipolar,” Eileen said. “She could say things about you, too.” Rinna’s response? “The bipolar comment doesn’t bother me — it’s Yolanda’s righteousness about it that bothers me. It’s like, ‘I could do this, but I never would.’ Well, guess what? You just did.”</span></p><p><b>Yolanda Confronts Lisa Rinna for Spreading Rumors</b></p><p>Yolanda ended up confronting Lisa Rinna at Erika’s party, and she raised a lot of issues. “When you say that, you spoke in front of everybody, that I have ‘Hauschen-Mauchen’ whatever disease. In that moment, I laughed it off,” she fumed. “I thought it was hysterical. I was like, ‘I don’t even know what that means — it’s not even in my vocabulary.’ When you left, when my nurse read me the definition of Munchausen disease, that was the biggest f–king blow I’ve ever had in my life.”</p><p><span>Yolanda wasn’t having Lisa’s apology, and completely lost it when Lisa Vanderpump came to her name-twin’s defense. “Why are you sitting here and even f–king defending this conversation, Lisa?” she said, slamming her hands on the table. “Why would you even sit here and defend that?”</span></p><p>To make things even more awkward, Erika asked Lisa Rinna to rat out the original Munchausen accuser, and she flat out refused. Sure, everyone ended up “hugging it out,” but we have a feeling this isn’t the last time Yolanda and Lisa + Lisa will exchange words. In fact, they’ve still recently been fighting on Twitter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><b>Lisa Rinna Calls Kim a “Lunatic,” Makes Everyone Feel Awkward</b></p><p>Apparently, there just wasn’t enough drama this week because Lisa Rinna decided to bring up her fight with Kim Richards at a group brunch. And yes, Kyle was there. “It was some vicious, vile stuff that went on,” Lisa said before Kyle cut her off. “This is really uncomfortable for me,” Kyle interrupted. “I don’t like the ‘vicious’ and ‘vile’ and ‘problems’ — I don’t want to hear that about her.”</p><p><span>Kyle ended up leaving the table, but that didn’t stop Lisa from chatting about her sister. “Whatever it was, it was f–king weird,” she said, confiding to cameras, “Kim Richards is an addict. She’s a f–king lunatic. She comes at you like a f–king dog.”</span></p><p>Lisa’s vitriol aside, Kyle did confirm that she and her sister were “beginning a path to turn things around.”</p><p><b>Inside Erika and Tom’s Unusual Relationship</b></p><p>So, what’s the deal with <b>Tom Girardi</b>? He and Erika went on a double date with Lisa and Ken, and let’s just say a new side of Tom came out. … Not only did the the famous lawyer tell Erika to “go to her room” (to be fair, he was kinda-maybe joking), he got mad at her for interrupting and snapped: “Excuse me, Erika — this is me talking, not you.”</p><p>Lisa Vanderpump seemed a bit taken aback by Tom’s behavior, but Erika wasn’t sweating it. “Tom is always the boss,” she explained to cameras. “As a matter of fact, in my cell phone it comes up The Boss. The Boss is talking.” Question: Is Tom secretly Bruce Springsteen, y/n?</p><p>Tell<i> Us</i>: Is Yolanda being too hard on Lisa Rinna?</p><p><i>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</i> airs on Bravo on Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmhp5KderOxwpqnZqSZqK5uvsinpZplk5a5rb%2BMpKCmZaKesKmt0Z2qZpldm3qstc2gZJ2nl2LEcoKTb2htZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./riley-voelkel.html>&#171;&nbsp;Riley Voelkel Biography</a>
