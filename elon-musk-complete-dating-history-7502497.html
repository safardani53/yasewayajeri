Gwynne later told PEOPLE that she was attracted to Musk's "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>quiet intensity</a>," but he occasionally had a "silly" side. The couple dated for about a year, but during that time, they were serious enough to introduce each other to their families. Musk even gifted Gwynne a gold and emerald necklace for her birthday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shortly after Gwynne returned from studying abroad, she and Musk called it quits. Gwynne explained that Musk was "not very good at a long-distance relationship," and talking on the phone "seemed like a waste of time to him."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2022, Gwynne auctioned off items from their time together, including several photos and a handwritten card, to help pay for her stepson's college tuition. Ahead of the auction, she recalled that her time dating Musk was "amazing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gwynne said: "His brilliance and his vision was balanced with a bit of wide-eyed wonder back then. ... I can always tell the stories of Elon predicting the future of electric cars well before I passed them on the road every day. But I also have the memories of Elon's family welcoming me into their home in Toronto during the holidays in 1994.

At the time, Justine was a freshman and Musk was a sophomore. He approached her after <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>noticing her</a> across the common room.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He invited me out for ice cream. I said yes, but then blew him off with a note on my dorm-room door," she wrote in a 2010 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Marie Claire</a> essay. "Several hours later, my head bent over my Spanish text in an overheated room in the student center, I heard a polite cough behind me. Musk was smiling awkwardly, two chocolate-chip ice cream cones dripping down his hands. He's not a man who takes no for an answer."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although Musk later transferred schools, he continued to pursue Justine. However, they split before Justine moved to Japan for a year to teach English as a second language. A week after she returned home to Canada, he happened to call her. Justine moved to California to be with Musk, and they soon became engaged. In 2000, the couple tied the knot.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Looking back on their relationship, Justine wrote that there were early "warning signs" about their future, including Musk's comments about being an "alpha."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She claimed: "In the months following our wedding, a certain dynamic began to take hold. Musk's judgment overruled mine, and he was constantly remarking on the ways he found me lacking. 'I am your wife,' I told him repeatedly, 'not your employee.' 'If you were my employee,' he said just as often, 'I would fire you.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2002, the couple welcomed their first child, Nevada Alexander, who died at just 10 weeks old of sudden infant death syndrome. In her essay, Justine shared that the couple grieved in vastly different ways but decided to try to get pregnant again as soon as possible. They later welcomed twins <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Griffin and Vivian</a> in 2004 and a set of triplets — Kai, Saxon and Damian — in 2006.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Justine recalled that they had a "dream lifestyle" filled with extravagant events, multimillion-dollar homes and a staff that catered to all their needs. However, she felt a lack of "intimacy and empathy" from Musk.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She wrote that a car accident served as a "wake-up call" for her. "I barely recognized myself," she said. "I had turned into a trophy wife." Shortly after the accident, the couple tried counseling, but after just a month, Musk allegedly gave her an ultimatum: to live life as they had or get a divorce. He filed for divorce the next day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following their 2008 split, the couple went through a complicated divorce, ending with shared custody of their five children.

The pair first connected at a bar in London, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Business Insider</a>. Riley later recalled that she didn't know who he was at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I remember thinking that this guy probably didn't get to talk to young actresses a lot and that he seemed quite nervous," she told biographer Ashlee Vance. "I decided to be really nice to him and give him a nice evening. Little did I know that he'd spoken to a lot of pretty girls in his life."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just six weeks after Musk filed for divorce from Justine, he and Riley were engaged. Riley moved to L.A., and they tied the knot at Dornoch Cathedral in Scotland in 2010. Musk <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>filed for divorce</a> just two years later.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was an amazing four years.

Despite their split, she added that they remained friendly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She told the outlet: "I suppose the reason to get remarried was just because it felt silly to be together unmarried after having been married.

While Depp claimed in court papers in his 2022 defamation trial against Heard that Musk and Heard <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>secretly began dating</a> in 2015, Heard said in court she was not acquainted with Musk until <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>the 2016 Met Gala</a> after Depp "stood [her] up" on the red carpet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I didn't recognize [Musk] until we started talking and he reminded me we had met once before," Heard recalled during the trial.

It's a pretty crazy sacrifice and only half of the population has to do it," she said in an interview. "It was really profound to me when I decided I was going to do it, to actually go through the act of unprotected sex. ... I do actually just really love my boyfriend. So I was like, 'You know, sure.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-100 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In May, Musk and Grimes welcomed their first baby together, a son named <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>X Æ A-12</a>, or X for short.

"She's staying with me now and Baby X is in the adjacent room."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-106 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite their separation, the couple welcomed their second baby via surrogate that December. Grimes confirmed the birth during an interview with Vanity Fair in March 2022, sharing that they welcomed a baby girl named <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Exa "Y" Dark Sideræl</a>. She also shared that she and Musk were back together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-108 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There's no real word for it. I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we're very fluid," she said. "We live in separate houses. We're best friends. We see each other all the time. ... We just have our own thing going on, and I don't expect other people to understand it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-110 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But on the same day Vanity Fair published the story, Grimes shared that the couple's relationship status had changed since the interview.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-112 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Me and E have broken up *again* since the writing of this article," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>she tweeted</a>.
