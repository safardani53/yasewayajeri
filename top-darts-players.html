He improved his world ranking from 38th to 4th in just one year.</p><p>After his breakout year, Gerwen has never taken a step back.

He got into the business at the right time as sports started being televised.</p><p>His popularity increased as fans loved his arrogant attitude and brilliant gameplay. Television made him into a huge phenomenon in the darts community.</p><p>Even the great Phil Taylor looked up to Eric during his rookie years. Bristow mentored the great Phil Taylor and made him into what he is now.</p><p>Not to mention, he even sponsored him with £10,000 for his game development. Further, this helped Phil grow and become one of the top darts players.</p><p>Moreover, the darts player retired in 2007, after which he worked as a commentator. However, he still used to play darts but not on a competitive level.</p><p><a href=#>Get on- <strong>9 Martial Arts Chest Protectors To Choose</strong><strong>&nbsp;>></strong></a></p><h3>2. Raymond van Barneveld</h3><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Raymond van Barneveld</a> is a Dutch professional darts player. When talking about top darts players, it is hard not to mention Barneveld.</p><p>The 56 year old is one of the most successful Dutch darts players as of now. Further, he is also responsible for increasing the popularity of darts in the Netherlands.</p><p>Barneveld has won over 15 major titles, which include five world championships. On top of that, he also has a Primer League trophy.</p><p>Likewise, he is also one of three top darts players to have won five world championships. This feat in itself takes Raymond to the next level.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Raymond_van_Barneveld-300x300.jpg><p>Many fans even say that Barneveld is the greatest darts player ever, even greater than Phil Taylor. However, Raymond himself disagreed with this statement.</p><p>Furthermore, he added, saying that it was a pleasure to be in the same conversation as the legend Phil Taylor. Barneveld has beaten Taylor on various occasions.</p><p>One such occasion was the 2007 PDC World Championships, where the Dutch darts player had a triumphant victory over the legendary Phil Taylor.</p><p>Besides that, he is also a former world’s number one ranked player from January to June of 2008. As of now, he has a world ranking of 55.</p><h3>1. Phil Taylor</h3><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Phil Taylor</a> is a retired English professional darts player. He is simply the G.O.A.T. when it comes to darts. With his steady hands, he has outrun many darts players.</p><p>Taylor dominated the entire darts competing scenario for over two decades. He won a total of 214 professional tournaments in his 31-year career.</p><p>Out of the 214 titles, 85 are major titles, whereas 16 are world titles. Further, the interesting part is that he won these titles in two different generations.</p><p>He was recognized as the king of the World Championship as he won eight consecutive world titles from 1955 to 2002.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Phil_Taylor.jpg><p>No one from this period ever even imagined conquering the title. Every competitor knew it would take more than dedication to defeat Taylor.</p><p>His excellence and consistent performance never seem to lack throughout his career. So many good players came and went, but Phil always knew how to deliver.</p><p>Moreover, this is also because darts throwing is not as physically competing as other sports such as football or basketball.</p><p>Therefore, until and unless there is a vision impairment in the player, they can have a long-lasting career. Likewise, in Phil’s case, they can have a long-lasting prime.</p><p>Furthermore, due to his <span class="sc-1d8dc42-1 ibmLGk">superb</span> and powerful dart-throwing technique, fans nicknamed Tylor “The Power.”</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Darts playing may not be as physical as other sports. However, this sport is as challenging as any other game.</p><p>To maintain a steady hand to have a good throw is something hard to master. However, no matter how hard a situation is, it has never stopped human beings from trying.</p><p>Hence, these individuals have set the tone in darts playing. Their hard work and dedication in their game are unbelievable.</p><p>As a result, let’s appreciate the top darts player who made the game of darts as legendry as we know it to be.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunDAzqlknZmiqcBuvMuasJ6qo2Q%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./erika-flores.html>&#171;&nbsp;Erika Flores</a>
