I learned to play the drums.</p><p>“I even tried my hand at being a promoter. I was not allowed to play music because my grades were so bad. My father would say to me, ‘Don’t call yourself a musician just because you play an instrument’.</p><p>“So I wasn’t allowed to be a musician. We had that painfully awkward conversation about what I was going to do with my life. I didn’t know what to say but I knew this was it. I wrote a runaway note. This began the separation between my father and I.</p><p>“He called me the next morning and said, ‘Don’t ever do that again’. And I said, ‘I don’t have to’.”</p><p>Dave went on to become the drummer for punk band Scream before joining grunge three-piece Nirvana with Kurt Cobain.</p><p>He recalled that those days in the band were tough — but some of the best of his life.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><h3>'I was lost'</h3><p>Dave, who will speak at four more events across the US next month, said: “There was no food. There was a gas station across the road that sold three corn dogs for 99 cents. I learnt to budget three corn dogs a day. We were writing songs every day. Kurt was so prolific.”</p><p>As their fame reached fever pitch however, Kurt shot himself as he struggled to cope with life in the limelight</p><p>Dave explained: “When Kurt died, I was lost. I was totally numb. I turned off the radio, I put my instruments away and I couldn’t bear it. I needed to disappear and get away.”</p><p>Dave flew to Ireland to spend time alone and said he came across a hitchhiker wearing a Kurt T-shirt –– which prompted him to change his mind.</p><p>He flew back to the US and created Foo Fighters.</p><p>Dave added: “I picked 15 of my favourite songs I had written and recorded by myself. I called it Foo Fighters because I wanted people to think it was a band. I handed them out to 100 people. And I thought, this is it. This is what will save my life.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>OH SNAPOUT OF IT, WILL YOU TOM</h2><p>MAKING your fans pay for a picture is tight at the best of times.</p><p>But Tom Hiddleston will be taking this to the next level at the MCM Comic Con in London.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cd2e7bd5-c245-4364-b643-74169435a81f.jpg><p>The Loki actor is charging fans £225 to have a photograph taken with him next month at the annual convention where fans dress up as their favourite characters from comics, video games and movies.</p><p>To add insult to financial injury, those who are willing to fork out the hefty sum for a snap with Tom won’t get even near him.</p><p>Organisers of the event, at London’s ExCeL, have revealed that a pane of Plexiglass will keep them apart. Now, I do of course understand that because of Covid everything has to be terribly boring and laborious in the name of keeping everyone safe.</p><p>But in this case, fans will surely each be taking home with them just a really awkward picture of themselves standing side by side with Tom. I just hope the fans save their hard-earned and don’t waste it on this. Instead, just find a pal who’s good at Photoshop and use it to get yourself a snap with Tom for free.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>ADDER BOY, OLLY</h2><p>HE gave the music a break to take a starring turn in hit Channel 4 show It’s A Sin last year.</p><p>Now Olly Alexander is back with his third Years & Years album.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000683062392-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000683062514-1.jpg><p>The singer posed in these black trousers and spiked cuffs with a snake around his neck to promote Night Call, above, which is out on January 7 next year.</p><p>Olly, who performs solo under the name Years & Years, also released Crave, his first single from the record yesterday.</p><p>The singer said about the upbeat dance track: “In the past I felt like I’ve been dominated by toxic relationships, and I felt like it would be fun to turn it on its head.”</p><p>Fans of Olly’s are going to love it.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>JESY’S PANIC ATTACKS</h2><p>JESY NELSON broke down in tears as she opened up about her struggles in Little Mix.</p><p>In an extended version of the interview with the singer I brought you excerpts from yesterday, she spoke at length about the issues she encountered in the group alongside Leigh-Anne Pinnock, Jade Thirlwall and Perrie Edwards.</p><p>She said on the podcast Reign With Josh Smith: “The panic attacks are horrible. Unless you’ve ever experienced it, it’s really hard to understand what it makes you feel like.</p><p>“You literally feel like you’re being strangled, you can’t breathe. For that to happen when we were about to go live, I knew something wasn’t right. Every day I was getting worse and worse. I knew I had to do something about it. When you’re in that headspace sometimes you never think you’re going to get out of it.”</p><p>Jesy, who quit Little Mix in December after nine years, added: “I was crying all the time because I so badly wanted to be accepted and just didn’t want to be compared all the time.</p><p>“I was lying most of the time. I was good at just pretending a lot of the time. It just got too much and I needed to take control and look after myself.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>PETE RINGS CHANGES</h2><p>Former Libertines star Pete Doherty has got his happy ending after cleaning up his act.</p><p>The singer is engaged to Katia de Vidas, who he has lived with in the South of France for a number of years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000683053803-1.jpg><p>Katia revealed her sparkler in this Instagram pic of her and Pete, along with pal Jack Jones of rock band Trampolene, centre, and Luna the dog.</p><p>Pals said the pair had been engaged “for a while” but had kept it quiet.</p><p>Pete’s new life is a far cry from his days as a hellraiser who found fame thanks to his romance with Kate Moss. He has been sober for almost three years and said he was busy working on new music.</p><p>The singer, who did a gig in London in July, said: “I’m in recovery. I’m 2.5 years clean of heroin, which is a big deal for me. I’m ticking along writing music.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>VANILLA SELL-OUT</h2><p>VANILLA ICE is the latest star to sell out and go woke for cash.</p><p>The American has re-worked his cult 1990 track Ice Ice Baby as part of a deal with Samsung Electronics.</p><p>The song now goes, “Reduce your ice, ice baby...” as the rapper calls on the world to increase the temperature of their freezers, which could lower each individual’s carbon footprint.</p><p>Samsung claims that if every household in Europe raised their freezer temperature by 1C, it would save more than 1million tons of emissions annually.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The rapper added: “I’m so excited to work with Samsung on this project as music is a great way to spread this environmental story.
