data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong></a> may be most well known for her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>extensive career</a> as <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the speaker</a> of the United States <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>House of Representatives</a> since 2019. However, when it comes to her personal life, she is also a devout mother of five as well. According to the biography <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Madam Speaker: Nancy Pelosi and the Lessons of Power</a>, Nancy was strict, but had a whimsical side while raising her children as a full-time mother in San Fransisco.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Nancy and her family had a shock on October 28, 2022, when her husband<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;</a><strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Paul Pelosi</a> </strong>was the victim of an intruder in their home, who attacked him. The suspect &nbsp;<strong>David DePape,&nbsp;</strong>42, was taken into custody, after police saw him attack the House Speaker’s husband with a hammer, and he was charged with attempted homicide, assault with a deadly weapon, elderly abuse, and burglary, as well as other felonies. A spokesperson for Pelosi shared the news in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>statement</a>. “Early this morning, an assailant broke into the Pelosi residence in San Francisco and violently assaulted Mr. Pelosi.&nbsp; The assailant is in custody and the motivation for the attack is under investigation.&nbsp; Mr. Pelosi was taken to the hospital, where he is receiving excellent medical care and is expected to make a full recovery,” they said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>While many politicians shared their well-wishes for Paul to make a speedy recovery, Republican Senator&nbsp;<strong>Rand Paul&nbsp;</strong>also <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>included a dig</a> at Nancy and Paul’s daughter&nbsp;<strong>Christine,&nbsp;</strong>referencing a tweet where she made light of an incident where the senator was attacked by a neighbor. “No one deserves to be assaulted. Unlike Nancy Pelosi’s daughter who celebrated my assault, I condemn this attack and wish Mr. Pelosi a speedy recovery,” he wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Pelosi’s children often spoke fondly of her. But where exactly are Nancy Pelosi’s five kids now? Keep reading to find out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/nancy-pelosis-kids-ss-post1.jpg><h2>Alexandra Pelosi</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Alexandra, 52, is Nancy Pelosi’s youngest daughter. An Emmy-nominated documentary filmmaker and journalist, Alexandra’s most recent work is her 2020 Showtime documentary: American Selfie: One Nation Shoots Itself.&nbsp;The film chronicles New York City during the beginning of the pandemic in March and April of 2020, highlighting America’s darkest moments.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“The purpose of this film was to make an artifact of how America looks in 2020 so that future generations can look back at this moment in time and say, ‘Oh, that’s where it all went down, it all fell apart,” Alexandra said in an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW</a> with&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife</strong>. Another strong angle of the documentary is highlighting the negative effects that social media has on society’s mental health, especially when it comes to the constant spreading misinformation.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Another notable work of hers includes Journey’s with George, a six time Emmy-nominated film she made while following <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>George W. Bush</strong></a>‘s 2000 presidential campaign while she worked with NBC.&nbsp;Although Alexandra is liberal leaning herself, she likes to keep an open mind. “How boring of a world is it to live in a place where everybody agrees with each other?” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/nancy-pelosis-kids-ss-post2.jpg><h2>Paul Pelsoi Jr.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Paul Pelosi Jr, 53, Nancy’s only son, is a business analyst and real estate broker, according to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>U.S Sun</a>. He has been tied to various fraud and bribery schemes, according to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail</a>. Via the report, Paul was hired by several businesses that have allegedly been investigated by the Security and Exchange Commission.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>For example, in 2007, he was appointed as Senior Vice President of InfoUSA, which investigated the founder for allegedly flying <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Hillary Clinton</strong></a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Bill Clinton</strong></a> on private jets. However, the charges were dropped, according to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>New York Post</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Paul was also the co-founder of an environmentally friendly company called Natural Blue Resources Inc, which was later charged with fraud. The company was allegedly being run by a man named <strong>Joseph Corazzi</strong>, who was not legally allowed to be an officer of a public company, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Forbes</a>. This is because Corazzi allegedly overstated his assets in a 2002 case.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>However, Paul was fired from Natural Blue Resources Inc due to fundraising contracts, and the SEC stated that Paul wasn’t involved in the reason why the company was being investigated. Currently, Paul has never been charged with a crime himself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/nancy-pelosis-kids-ss-post3.jpg><h2>Christine Pelosi</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Like her mother, Christine Pelosi, 56, is part of the Democratic party, currently serving in the California Democratic Party Women’s Caucus Chair. She is also a former attorney, receiving her law degree from the University of California, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Huffington Post</a>. She was written successful books, titled Campaign Boot Camp: Basic Training for Future Leaders and Campaign Boot Camp 2.0, using the material to guide her leadership bootcamps.&nbsp;She has also been writing articles for The Huffington Post since 2007. Christine currently has a daughter Isabella with her husband Pete Kaufman, who is an Emmy-nominated filmmaker.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Christine did face some backlash in March 2020 for a tweet, where she made light of a 2017 incident where Senator Rand Paul was attacked by a neighbor.&nbsp;<strong>Rene Boucher&nbsp;</strong>attacked Rand while he was doing yard work in 2017 and was later charged with felony assault and sentenced to months in prison. After the senator tested positive for COVID-19 in March 2020, Christine took to Twitter and shared a message that said, “Rand Paul’s neighbor was right.” The tweet was removed for violating Twitter’s Rules.</p><h2>Nancy Corinne Pelosi</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Nancy Pelosi’s eldest daughter Nancy Corrine was born in 1964. When she got married in 2008 to businessman Theodore Jeffery Prowda, she changed her name to Nancy Prowda. Although she has stayed mainly out of the spotlight and little is known about her career, she briefly opened up to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Washington Post </a>in 2019 about her mother’s parenting and political style. “She has a way of delivering her message to the intended without rubbing their face in it — without directly telling them why she’s so disappointed. It’d be better if she’d just get mad at you” she said.</p><h2>Jacqueline Pelosi</h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>Out of all of Nancy Pelosi’s children, Jacqueline has kept her life the most private. She reportedly currently owns and teaches at an art studio, and has three sons with her husband Michael Kenneally.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme82apZyxXaWyrbvSomSkoZSoenWDkm9qbG1f</p></div><div id=links><a href=./spice-king.html>&#171;&nbsp;Spice King- Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; Biography</a>
