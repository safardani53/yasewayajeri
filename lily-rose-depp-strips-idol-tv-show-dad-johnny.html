I did that literally just to say you don’t have to label yourself, and then everyone was like, ‘Lily-Rose Depp comes out as gay’.”</p><p>Dad Johnny, who split from Vanessa when his daughter was 13, said her gender fluidity did not surprise him.</p><p>He said: “I already knew because she tells me everything — she’s not afraid to say anything to me. We’re super-tight and I’m very proud of our relationship.</p><p>“Lily’s really together. She’s a sharp kid and one of the smartest human beings I have ever met.”</p><p>While her dad’s abusive marriage with actress <a href=#>Amber Heard</a> has been played out in the courts, Lily-Rose has had a few high-profile romances of her own.</p><p>She dated Timothee Chalamet for two years after they met on the set of Netflix’s historical drama The King in 2018, and put on a very passionate display on a yacht during a trip to Italy the following summer before they split in April 2020.</p><p>The star then got Elvis actor Austin Butler All Shook Up and sparked rumours of a romance in 2021 when they were spotted kissing in the street after a night out in <a href=#>London</a>, but the relationship seems to have fizzled out quickly.</p><p>She moved on to French rapper Yassine Stein, who she dated for around a year, frequently kissing and cuddling in public.</p><p>While the actress hasn’t talked about her romances with men, she was happy to go public with her new love 070 Shake, who she began dating in January.</p><p>Earlier this month she confirmed rumours they were a couple by posting an Instagram picture of herself kissing the New Yorker — real name Danielle Balbuena — with the words: “4 MONTHS WITH MY CRUSH.”</p><p>And she made sure her girlfriend knew just how much she had missed her when she returned to LA from Cannes this weekend, going straight into a passionate kiss on the street.</p><p>Recently, Lily-Rose complained that her romances with A-list actors and her relationship with her dad had overshadowed her acting work.</p><p>She said: “I feel like for a lot of my career, people have really wanted to define me by the men in my life, whether that’s my family members or my boyfriends.”</p><p>Lily-Rose — who got her acting break at 15 in 2014 horror-comedy Tusk, which starred her dad — also hit out at being called a “nepo baby”.</p><p>She said: “People are going to have preconceived ideas about you or how you got there.</p><p>“I can definitely say that nothing is going to get you the part except for being right for the part.</p><p>“The internet cares a lot more about who your family is than the people who are casting you in things.</p><p>“Maybe you get your foot in the door, but you still just have your foot in the door. There’s a lot of work that comes after that.</p><p>“If somebody’s mum or dad is a doctor, and then the kid becomes a doctor, you’re not going to be like, ‘Well, you’re only a doctor because your parent is a doctor’.</p><p>“It’s like, ‘No, I went to medical school and trained’.”</p><h2>‘The sleaziest love story in all of Hollywood’</h2><p>While she continues to model, Lily-Rose’s acting career has gone from strength to strength in recent years with roles in 2016 drama Planetarium opposite <a href=#>Natalie Portman</a>, and 2019’s The King, which was produced by <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a>.</p><p>As Jocelyn in The Idol, she plays a pop icon who is attempting to recover her career after a nervous breakdown, which allows Lily-Rose to showcase her singing and acting talents.</p><p>Euphoria creator Sam Levinson wrote the series with Blinding Lights hitmaker The Weeknd, who earlier this month said he would be reverting to his birth name of Abel Tesfaye.</p><p>Levinson described Lily-Rose’s audition for him as “sensational”, adding: “She’s also just one of the best collaborators you could wish for.</p><p>“She can act, she can sing, and her and Abel’s chemistry is off the charts.”</p><p>But the project, which she billed on her Instagram as “the sleaziest love story in all of Hollywood”, has been embroiled in controversy.</p><p>In the series, Lily-Rose pleasures herself with ice cubes and her character is shown in a “compromising” photo.</p><p>Insiders told Rolling Stone magazine the show was almost completely reshot to give it less of a feminine perspective after Tesfaye demanded more focus on his character.</p><p>Pet Sematary actress Amy Seimetz was said to have directed around 80 per cent of the scenes, and her departure resulted in Levinson stepping in to take over as director.</p><p>It is claimed the raunchy rewrite has so many sex scenes that one source called it “sexual torture porn”.</p><p>The series, which begins on Monday on Sky Atlantic, was widely slammed when it debuted in Cannes last week.</p><p>The New York Times dismissed the show as “a Pornhub-homepage odyssey” starring “Lily-Rose Depp’s areolas,” while entertainment news website The Wrap branded it “luxury sleaze”.</p><p>And a reporter from showbiz bible Variety tweeted: “I don’t need to see any more of Lily-Rose Depp naked.”</p><p>But the star defended the nudity, saying: “I think the occasional bareness of the character physically mirrors the bareness that we get to see emotionally in her and that’s something I felt was really important.”</p><p>And Sharon Stone, whose infamous leg-crossing scene in Basic Instinct caused a sensation three decades ago, praised the project as “sure-footed”.</p><p>In a tweet, she said the show “addresses the root of the crisis in entertainment: Which comes first, the brilliance or the heartache?”</p><p>With upcoming leads in The Governesses — a movie adaptation of novelist Anne Serre’s erotic fairytale — and a remake of gothic classic Nosferatu opposite Bill Skarsgard, we are set to see a lot more of Lily-Rose Depp in the future.</p><p>And as the storm rages over The Idol, the actress remains characteristically defiant.</p><p>She said: “I’m not interested in making anything puritanical.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"I’m not interested in making anything that doesn’t challenge me or challenge other people.</p><p>“I think this show is fearless, and that’s something that I’ve been really excited and proud to dive into.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/f63b76c1-0b41-4e80-ae70-1d908986d94e.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/johnny-depp-daughter-lilly-rose-333161943.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/573f7195-d100-40b2-888a-2b5337e96b7c.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwYmiEd4KYaKOipKliv7C%2FxGabnqigYsC1vsipqmahlKS5bsDVZqqhp6disaKwjKOmoaaernw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./4bdxiqojejuw-qt1e6t1t4ymk6vkqh4j.html>&#171;&nbsp;Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV</a>
