She can’t seem to help herself.</p><p>I’ve lost count of the number of photoshoots and advertising campaigns <a href=#>The Moss </a>has stripped off for and this latest opportunity is to promote her very own <a href=#>wellness brand CosMoss</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000665771302.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000755430810.jpg><p>Following in the footsteps of other slebs who are currently cashing in on their names by peddling products and ideas that will supposedly improve the lives of us mere mortals, Kate hasn’t hesitated to strip off and show her wares.</p><p>And it’s smart. It’s one thing being pretty and having a decent body but Kate has the brains to match. She’s worked out that she is worth considerably more in the nude.</p><p>There is more value in her posing naked because, let’s face it, there is no designer dress, no label or fancy outfit that is worth more than Moss in the buff.</p><p>I can’t say I buy into all this wellness malarkey but full respect to her for getting all nudie rudie for our pleasure. And her bank balance, of course.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON KATE MOSS">READ MORE ON KATE MOSS</h2><p>Y’all know by now I’m a fan of nudity. Can there be anything better than the naked body in all its natural form?</p><p>At 48, Moss doesn’t look half bad, does she? I mean, we don’t all have her vital statistics (even though I did ask my cosmetic surgeon for a pair of “Kate Moss breasts” when I went for a breast reduction 13 years ago).</p><h2>Savvy cookie</h2><p>Not all of us have that elfin, impish, petite body — slender and with curves in all the right places.</p><p>Her body, if you ask me, is nothing short of divine.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>And let’s not forget, this girl was modelling at 14 and at the age of 15 had a <a href=#>deeply compromising experience</a> when a photographer asked her to take her top off and she was forced to run away from the shoot in fear.</p><p>So I like the idea that she has taken back control and she does things on her terms now. That’s what I love about her.</p><p>Kate might no longer be at the top of her supermodel game as she nudges 50 but this savvy cookie has learned a thing or two along the way.</p><p>Not only has she set up her own modelling agency — because, quite frankly, what she doesn’t know about modelling ain’t worth knowing — but she’s also been going strong for over three decades.</p><p>We’ve grown accustomed to her pert boobs and peachy bum — she’s been showing it all off for years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000018063708.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000004887107.jpg><p>And we clearly love it, and it must absolutely work for the advertisers and all the endorsements she’s been involved with, because we have her body engraved on our hearts and the products imprinted in our brains.</p><p>Who can forget the 2013 St Tropez fake tan campaign, with Moss absolutely starkers? If that doesn’t make you want to tan safely, I don’t know what will.</p><p>Fact remains: sex sells. Or more accurately, “sexy sells”.</p><p>Because there is no direct correlation between a naked body and sex itself, but the suggestion and titillation of nudity definitely grabs our attention. And when it comes to sexy, <a href=#>Moss has it in bucketloads</a>.</p><p>There is something pure and very simple about her body and her constantly showing a willingness to expose it. I think this makes her not only beautiful but also rather unique.</p><h2>Constipated attitude</h2><p>She is showing that there doesn’t need to be anything complicated about nudity.</p><p>We are, all of us, after all, just bodies. We all have one.</p><p>I may be biased — and you’ll know this because I don’t stop droning on about it — but as a <a href=#>Swede</a> I am a lover of all things naked.</p><p>The Brits have always had a somewhat constipated attitude towards nudity and nakedness.</p><p>It always used to send chills down people’s spines because it was deemed provocative, even suggestive or exhibitionist, maybe even a bit pervy, when in fact it’s just incredibly natural.</p><p>But Moss has stuck two fingers up at that old stifled British perception of nudity. This girl is running her own race and doing her own thing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000755491095-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000755491076.jpg><p>She has paved the way, blazed a trail for normalising nakedness. She’s happy to share her body because she sees it just for what it is — it’s a vessel. And it’s also one that can make her a lot of dosh. And why not?</p><p>You might say that it’s OK for her because<a href=#> she’s a model</a> and has an enviable figure.</p><p>But I believe that if we’re wanting to accept bodies and admire their beauty, we need to see all shapes and sizes — big, small, short, tall. And Moss.</p><p>She hasn’t always looked after her body, <a href=#>succumbing to recreational drugs</a> and confessing to not working out until very recently.</p><p>I’ve spent much of this hot summer walking around the house with nothing on. Literally, not a stitch. Sometimes I put on an apron if I was deep-frying something in the kitchen — and it was much to the disgust of my Ungratefuls.</p><p>And at 55, I’m just a few years older than Moss but I want to “standardize” the naked body in order that we value it, whatever shape it is.</p><p>Mine might be deemed a bit scrawny and wrinkly in places but it is what it is.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>So I say more power to her elbow (and all parts of her anatomy) because when she was young, Moss was embarrassed about her body and now she’s showing it off, loud and proud.</p><p>And I’m pretty sure if someone wanted to pay me to show mine off in the way that Moss does hers — demurely covering up the essential bits — I’m pretty sure I’d oblige.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000755430790.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000057514007.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huYGx%2Bc4GQaKKarJViurC%2F0maspaqZoK5uts6nqqynnmK7trDIrbBo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./travis-bennetts-girlfriend-list.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is Travis Bennett Dating Travis Bennett's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</a>
