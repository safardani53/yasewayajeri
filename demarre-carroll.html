Carroll and his teammates had early success when they won Alabama 6A titles for their team.</p><p>Moreover, he earned several honors and accolades as a young high school kid, which boosted his confidence. For leading his team to win consecutive state titles, he was named first-team All-State and MVP in High School 6A Finals.</p><p>He had the strong support of his family members, especially his mother. Besides his study hours, he was free to practice basketball with the young boys in his locality, who upgraded his skills.</p><p>Moving onto his stats in high school, he had 17.8 points and 9.1 rebounds per game in his junior year. John Carroll won the state championship with a 36-0 record with his unsurpassed contribution.</p><p>He further improved his gameplay in his senior year.
