Unfortunately, no cause of death was given and still, there’s no official word on what happened.

But for now, it’s all mere speculation.</p><p>"This morning, Thursday, September 17th, we lost Terry Goodkind. It is a great loss. An unimaginable loss," the Facebook post said. "It is impossible to put into few words just how amazing of a man, a husband, a writer, a friend, and a human, Terry Goodkind truly was. He is already desperately missed. We are forever grateful for him having shared his life’s work with all of us, as he was always grateful to be held in our hearts."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My favorite author, Terry Goodkind, passed away this morning.

The Sword of Truth gave way to 20 more books in the series that fans would continue to follow.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Author <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Kevin J.
