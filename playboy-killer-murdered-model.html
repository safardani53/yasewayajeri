14, 1980, the 20-year-old rising star had been tipped to be "the next Marilyn Monroe", and had just starred in a film with Audrey Hepburn.</p><img

and rumoured pimp Paul Snider - who also took his own life in the murder-suicide.</p><p>Few people were more stunned by Snider's actions than his lodger and aspiring model, Patti Laurman, who discovered the crime scene when she was just 17.</p><p>"It was like a staged horror movie," she recalls.</p><p>"They were both dead. They were both naked. They’d been dead for at least eight hours.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000485596410.jpg><p>"Just the thought that could have been me is pretty scary, and I lived with someone that was able to do that."</p><p>Dorothy had been blasted in the face with a gun by her estranged husband, who then turned it on himself. She was even missing a finger where she'd held her hand up to defend herself.</p><p>Patti recounts the lead up to the gruesome murder and what it was like to discover the bodies on new Crime and Investigation documentary, I Lived With A Killer.</p><h2>Playboy came calling</h2><p>Dorothy and Snider met when she was 17 and still at school and he was 26.</p><p>They quickly fell for each other and in 1979 Snider persuaded Dorothy to pose for a nude modelling shoot, which he then sent to Playboy.</p><p>Liking what he saw, <a href=#>Hugh Hefner</a> requested a meeting with Dorothy and her career sky-rocketed.</p><p>She was made Playmate Of The Month in August 1979, landed a part in popular TV show Fantasy Island and appeared on numerous talk shows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Patti-Laurman-I-lived-with-a-killer.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000485596402.jpg><h2>A shady past</h2><p>Dorothy and Snider had married in June 1979, but underneath his charming facade Snider had a seedy past.</p><p>He was suspected of being a pimp and had been under police investigation in 1976.</p><p>On top of that he was unable to work in America because he was Canadian and didn't have the right visa, so it was down to Dorothy to make the money.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000485596401-e1556371407235.jpg><p>To the outside world however, Snider and his wife seemed like the ultimate power couple - she was even made Playmate Of The Year in 1980.</p><p>He was also the model's agent, so when an impressionable Patti met him at 17 she believed he could help launch her career.</p><p>But it soon became apparent that all was not as rosy as it seemed.<br></p><h2>Driven apart</h2><p>As Dorothy's success grew, she was spending less and less time with Snider.</p><p>Then things changed dramatically when she was cast in director P<span id=E1850>eter </span><span id=E1852>Bogdanovich's movie, They All Laughed.</span></p><p><span id=E1852>She went off to begin filming in New York in 1980, while Snider stayed in Los Angeles.</span></p><p><span id=E1852>Peter and Dorothy fell in love, and in June that year Dorothy wrote to Snider saying she was ending their marriage.
