If he moved them it would be okay.</p><p>"I tried to speak to his son and asked him to ask if the cars could be moved.</p><p>"He said he would but from that day on he hasn't even looked at me.</p><p>"Why should I have to move my car? It's very upsetting because he's taking it out on us."</p><p>Another neighbour said: "Cars appear in our spaces when we're out at work.</p><p>"Wildin has cameras looking out onto the street to spot when we move our cars out of our spaces.</p><p>"It's very intimidating. No one likes living here when you come back after work and feel deflated pulling into the street.</p><p>"I don't understand why he feels he needs to make his neighbours suffer."</p><p>A third neighbour said: "He sits there watching the cameras and plays cat and mouse with his collection of classic cars.</p><p>"He is a bloody nightmare and he is making people's lives hell.</p><p>"The illegal sports centre doesn't worry me but he's blaming us neighbours for the council's actions so he's decided to cause parking mayhem."</p><p>A fourth resident added: "The parking here is terrible and he is causing a lot of aggro. He's doing it on purpose too.</p><p>"Nothing has changed in the two years I have lived here and something should be done about it.</p><p>"The complex shouldn't have been built. The law is law. Why should he get away with it?"</p><h2>COURT OUT</h2><p>The first of Wildin's five court defeats came in September 2018 when a High Court injunction was <a href=#>handed down initially giving him until the end of April 2020 to remove the building</a>.</p><p>He failed to comply with the injunction and was given a suspended sentence in June 2021.</p><p>Wildin then lost an appeal against the sentence at the Court of Appeal that November and he was ordered to demolish the complex by March 10 2022.</p><p>But <a href=#>when Wildin's defiance continued</a>, the six-week suspended sentence for contempt of court was activated on August 13 2022.</p><p>Once released from HMP Cardiff, he was given 18 weeks to "soft strip" the interior of the building to make it unusable.</p><p>That deadline expired in early January and his sentence was later upheld and he was ordered to pay £9,962 in costs to the district council.</p><p>During the latest hearing, Mr Wildin told the court: "I don't swear, I never shout. It's all wrong.</p><p>"Apart from one occasion I've never blocked drives parking cars."</p><p>He showed the judge an aerial photo, adding "more than half the cars on the street aren't mine".</p><p>He added: "The reason I had to have CCTV in the road was to check on my cars. The neighbours covered it, so I put taller units in.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"I get on with the neighbours, it's only a band of six of them who've come together against me," he added.</p><p>The application for an injunction over alleged anti-social behaviour has been made together by police and the district council.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-see-swns-story-swlncave-844911695.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-see-swns-story-swlncave-844911658.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4B6gY9vamtnpaDAbq7IoJ6eq6RiuqK6jJyYr51dl66vusSdZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ray-brown-jr.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ray Brown Jr.</a>
