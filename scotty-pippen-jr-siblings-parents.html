However, his parents divorced in 2021, citing irreconcilable differences, and now they are successfully co-parenting their children.</p><p>Even though the basketball player maintains a good relationship with both of his parents, he seems to share a closer connection with his father.&nbsp;</p><p>This was evident on September 30, 2022, when he posted a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">picture</a> with his father and captioned it with “Hoop dreams, Los Angeles Edition,” tagging Scottie.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Similarly, on March 8, 2022, Scotty Jr. shared a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video</a> from one of his tournaments where his father was present to show his support.
