She deserved it. If I get up I will murder you as well.”</p><p>Cook, 44, and support worker Jacqueline were in an “on and off relationship” after they met while on a night out in Aberdeen in February 2022.</p><p>He sometimes lived at her pad on the city’s Sunnyside Road but the High Court in Aberdeen was told she was desperate to end things after he turned violent.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>In one incident he beat her up and pulled clumps of hair from her head because she wouldn’t tell him she loved him.</p><p>Pals said she regularly turned up to work at a centre for children with learning difficulties with black eyes and a bruised and swollen face.</p><p>Jacqueline told a friend: “It’s getting scary now. I’ll have to watch my back to stay safe.”</p><p>In June 2022 he appeared in court charged with attacking her at the flat.</p><p>Two days before she died in January this year she let steel erector Cook stay over and the following day, Saturday, they went out drinking together.</p><p>He was caught on CCTV going through her mobile phone after she went to the toilet in a pub.</p><p>Hours later she went home alone while Cook stayed out alone and repeatedly called and texted her.</p><p>In a voicemail message left in the early hours, he said: “Tell me I’m f***ing wrong.</p><p>“Making a fool out of me. Standing telling me I’m wrong. I’m f***ing charming eh? Ruined my life.”</p><p>On&nbsp; Sunday Cook messaged his ex to tell her he’d murdered Jacqueline.</p><p>He said: “I killed her. I’m trying to work it out. She attacked me and I lost it. She’s bleeding from her head.</p><p>“Tell the kids I’m sorry. I really messed up this time.”</p><p>Jacqueline’s work pals raised the alarm when she didn’t turn up for work on the Monday.</p><p>Cops forced their way in and found bloodstains and splatter throughout the one-bedroom flat, as well as clumps of her hair.</p><p>Jacqueline was discovered lying on the floor with a bleach covered cloth over her face.</p><p>The cause of death was put down to massive head and neck injuries.</p><p>Prosecutor Shanti Maguire said: “This type of injury is seen most commonly in road traffic accidents and falls from a significant height. They can also be seen in severe assaults.”</p><p>Cook admitted murder and domestic abuse while out on bail and sobbed in court as Jacqueline’s injuries were read out.</p><p>After the hearing her brother Tony Kerr and sister Elizabeth Murray said: “Jaqueline was the light of our lives. She was so loved by all those who had the pleasure of knowing her.</p><p>“The day our sister’s life was taken was the day part of our lives were taken too. We will never truly heal from the pain.</p><p>“We have young grandkids asking where their aunt is. Those who Jacqueline worked with and supported, unable to understand why she no longer comes to work.</p><p>“We wouldn’t wish this on anybody.”</p><p>Detective Inspector James Callander, of Police Scotland’s Major Investigations Team, said: “Jacqueline Kerr was subjected to a brutal attack in her own home by Christopher Cook.</p><p>“He has now admitted responsibility for his violent behaviour, which resulted in the death of Jacqueline.</p><p>“While it cannot change what happened, I hope this outcome in court leads to some closure for Jacqueline’s family.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Cook, described as a prisoner in Barlinnie nick, will be sentenced next month.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/NINTCHDBPICT000850244320-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/stuart-patterson-pix-jacqueline-kerr-849491729.jpg><p><strong>We pay for your stories and videos!
