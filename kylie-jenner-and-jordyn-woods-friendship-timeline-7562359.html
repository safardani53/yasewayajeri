history through the years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Kylie Cosmetics CEO and Heir Jordyn founder built an inseparable friendship since first meeting in 2012, but their close bond took a dramatic turn after a very <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>public falling out</a> in February 2019.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the time, reports surfaced that Woods had <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>allegedly hooked up</a> with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Tristan Thompson</a>, the father of <a

The cheating scandal effectively ended her friendship with Jenner and the rest of the Kardashian-Jenner family.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It also led Kardashian and Thompson to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>split</a>. Weeks later, during an appearance on&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Red Table Talk</a>&nbsp;in March 2019, Woods vehemently denied sleeping with Thompson but admitted that they&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>shared a kiss</a> at an afterparty at his house. She also revealed that she&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>failed to disclose what had happened between them</a> the next day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Weeks after the incident, a source told PEOPLE that Jenner and Woods were “working on rebuilding their friendship," with the source adding, “Kylie has had a very hard time moving on from their friendship.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Added the insider in March 2019: “Kylie is still in contact with Jordyn occasionally, but they are never going to be best friends ever again. Kylie has moved on and seems very happy. It just didn’t make sense that Jordyn still had things at Kylie’s.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sources have confirmed that Jenner and Woods have <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>reunited in the years that followed</a>, but their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>July 2023 outing marked the first time they were seen publicly</a> since the scandal.
