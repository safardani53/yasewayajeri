The letters “LO” adorned one’s finger, and “VE” graced the other. When they seamlessly joined their fingers, the tattoos spelled out the word “Love.”</p><p>Shortly after the actress shared the Instagram story, The Tea Talk’s official page shared a screenshot of her story. Alongside the post, they captioned, “#madslewis and #haydenyezak both got matching tattoos!”&nbsp;</p><p>Upon seeing The Tea Talk’s post, fans and followers had mixed reactions to Lewis’s decision to get inked with her boyfriend, Yezak.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Some expressed concerns, with one person commenting, “Well, this is the beginning of the end,” and another stating, “Why don’t couples understand that getting matching tattoos is what tears their relationships apart?”&nbsp;</p><p>However, despite some expressing reservations about getting matching tattoos, some fans and followers also complimented their bond. One person expressed love for them as a couple, stating they had never seen the actress so happy and comfortable.</p><p>Similarly, another supporter shared their opinion, saying, “They’re a vibe, love ’em. The universe isn’t dooming their relationship because of a tattoo. Watch their YouTube channel; they match each other’s energy very well and seem so happy. Good for them and not giving (explicit) what anyone thinks.”</p><p>Moreover, the actress and Yezak appear to have a strong affinity for getting tattoos. In a recent picture <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared</a> by Lewis and her boyfriend on November 2, 2023, it is evident that their body is adorned with various tattoos.&nbsp;</p><p>More than Lewis, Yezak has an extensive collection of tattoos on his body. He even shared an Instagram story discussing the removal of specific tattoos from his hand.&nbsp;</p><p>To provide a comprehensive look at his tattoo journey, Yezak maintains a dedicated Instagram <a href=# rel=noopener>highlight</a> section, showcasing various videos and pictures related to his inked artwork.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mads Lewis and Hayden Yezak’s relationship timeline&nbsp;</h2><p>Lewis and Yezak officially <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> their relationship on May 15, 2023, through an Instagram post.

In the image, the actress was dressed in a gray crop top with a matching jeans jumpsuit, while her boyfriend wore a white and blue striped t-shirt featuring a Mickey Mouse print paired with blue jeans.</p><p>Upon seeing the post, one person commented, “Y’all are so cuteeeee I can’t!” while another expressed, saying, “DUDE, YOU ARE SO LUCKY.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ppppic.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Mads Lewis and Hayden Yezak have been together for nearly a year. (Source: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a>)</p><p>Since that day, the couple has consistently shared moments from their relationship on Instagram. On July 15, 2023, Yezak posted a series of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pictures</a> with Lewis, capturing intimate moments between them. Alongside the picture, he captioned, “My girl,” expressing his affection for her.</p><p>In response to the post, the actress affectionately commented, “My handsome man, I love you.”&nbsp;Numerous fans also flooded the comment section expressing their admiration for the couple, describing them as cute and the perfect match for each other.</p><p>Similarly, on September 17, 2023, the duo jointly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared</a> a series of black and white pictures of them with the caption, “Austin, Texas.” Despite sharing many cute pictures of them, they have not revealed the details of how they first met and started dating.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Meaning behind Mads Lewis’s tattoos&nbsp;</h2><p>Lewis doesn’t have many visible tattoos, but on December 37, 2022, she uploaded a TikTok video with the caption, “Me when I don’t show my tattoos.”</p><p>In the video, after smiling at the camera, the actress <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">turned</a> around and lifted her sweater to reveal her back, adorned with various ink designs—some big and others small.&nbsp;</p><p>The first tattoo Lewis added to her collection was a giant flower inked down the middle of her spine, bearing the word “beautiful.” Alongside this, she has a slogan tattooed on her back that reads “Just Remember You’re Beautiful.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>Likewise, the actress went on to share her most painful tattoo, a skeleton butterfly on her shoulder with the words “peace of mind” inked above and “anyways” tattooed below. She also revealed her smallest tattoo, a tiny cross on her foot, and seldom.</p><p>Later, when a fan asked to showcase her most meaningful tattoo, the influencer explained that each tattoo carries significance for her. She then pointed out that her favorite is a small bird inked on her shoulder with the word “birdie” underneath it.</p><p>Moreover, in December 2020, the actress got a matching hand tattoo with her ex-boyfriend Jaden Hossler. On Lewis’ hand, it said “left side,” and on Hossler’s hand, it said “right side.” However, the significance of the tattoos in their relationship or any hidden meaning remains unclear.</p><p>Following their separation, Lewis decided to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">remove</a> the matching hand tattoos. She shared a selfie on Instagram on April 27, 2023, with a bandage around her hand. Subsequently, on her Instagram Story, she provided a hint about undergoing tattoo removal.&nbsp;</p><p>The actress also filmed herself inside a tattoo removal clinic and tagged a company called Laser Away. Fans deduced that the bandage covered the exact location of her tattoo with Jaden, concluding that she must have had it removed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57xLGapa2jnsOme8yam6xlnJrEqr%2BMm6aynqKesq%2BwjK2YrayfpMBw</p></div><div id=links><a href=./the-best-celebrity-brand-partnerships-of-2023.html>&#171;&nbsp;The Best Celebrity Brand Partnerships of 2023</a>
