His oldest of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>all his kids</a> is,&nbsp;<strong>Ocean Whitaker</strong>, 33, he was born in 1990. Not only is he his father’s mini-me, but he also took after him and pursued an acting career. Some of Ocean’s editing credits include working on the following projects:&nbsp;Montebello, The Game of Silence, and Another Try. Although Forest welcomed most of his kids with his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ex-wife</a>, <strong>Keisha Nash</strong>, 51, he welcomed Ocean during a previous relationship. It is not publicly known who the 33-year-old’s birth mother is or if he has a relationship with his dad. Interestingly, he is not on social media and does not appear on his <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dad’s official Instagram account</a>, however, his sisters do.</p><h2>His Oldest Daughter, Autumn Whitaker</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Forest and Keisha welcomed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>three daughters</a> together during their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>25-year marriage</a>. Their eldest, is their beautiful daughter,&nbsp;<strong>Autumn Whitaker</strong>, 32, who was born in 1991. Interestingly, Autumn is actually Keisha’s from a prior relationship, however, she shares Forest’s last name. Not much is publicly known about the 32-year-old, as she takes after <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her brother</a> with a similarly private life. Although she’s not in the spotlight as much as her former step-dad, her IMDb page boasts two credits, one as a “short” and another in the makeup department. It is not known if she and Forest have a relationship, as she is also one of his kids not on his Instagram account.</p><h2>Forest’s Second Oldest Daughter, Sonnet Noel Whitaker</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Keisha and her former hubby’s second oldest is their daughter,&nbsp;<strong>Sonnet Noel Whitaker</strong>, 26, who <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>was born</a> in 1996. Not only is the brunette beauty one of the two often spotted on her dad’s social media, but she also pursued a career in entertainment. Most recently, Forest took to his Instagram to share Sonnet’s latest album,&nbsp;N.F.S.,&nbsp;which he shared on Oct. 28, 2022. “I’m so proud of my incredible daughter Sonnet for writing and recording N.F.S., her first album! Take a listen to #Inanaandtheband,” he captioned the photo of the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>album cover</a>.</p><h2>The Actor’s Youngest, True Whitaker</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>Finally, Forest’s youngest is his daughter,&nbsp;<strong>True Whitaker</strong>, 24, who was born in 1998. The bombshell is very active on social media and boasts over 6K followers on her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram account</a>.

In June 2021, he shared an adorable selfie with the ladies and noted how “happy” it made him to be around them. “I’m a happy, Dad! I get to spend time with my daughters True and Sonnet in New York,” he captioned <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the post</a>. A&nbsp; few days after that, he shared <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a photo</a> of them celebrating Father’s Day together. “A beautiful Father’s Day!
