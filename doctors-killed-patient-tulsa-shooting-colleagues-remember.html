killed Wednesday in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shooting at the Saint Francis Hospital Campus</a> in Tulsa, Okla., was beloved by his colleagues, who praised him for his patient-centered approach and as a kind and caring person.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Dr. Phillips was the consummate gentleman. He was — is — a man that we should all strive to emulate," Dr. Cliff Robertson, president and CEO of Saint Francis Health System, told reporters at a press conference on Thursday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Phillips was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>one of four victims killed</a>. His colleague in the orthopedics department, Dr. Stephanie Husen, a hospital receptionist at the clinic, Amanda Green, and a patient, William Love, also died in the shooting.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The gunman, Michael Louis, was a patient of Dr. Phillips', Tulsa Police Chief Wendell Franklin revealed Thursday. Police believe Louis took his own life as officers approached him on the second floor of the Natalie Medical Building.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Louis, 45, went into the hospital for back surgery on May 19 and was released five days later, Franklin said. After his release, Franklin said the suspect called several times during a period of several days, complaining of pain and wanting additional treatment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"On May 31st, Dr. Phillips saw Mr. Louis again for additional treatment. Yesterday, June 1st, Louis called Dr. Phillips office again complaining of back pain and wanting additional assistance," the police chief told reporters Thursday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Police found a letter on the suspect's body, which, Franklin said, "made it clear he came in with the intent to kill Dr. Phillips and anyone who got in his way. He blamed Dr. Phillips for the ongoing pain following the surgery."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">An emotional Dr. Robertson said he found it hard to believe anyone would target Dr. Phillips, who earned his medical degree at Harvard Medical School, according to his Massachusetts <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>physician profile</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The fact that some individual would go after Dr. Phillips is mind-blowing. He's one of those folks that, you know, his clinic cannot always be on time because he will spend every minute with patient that they need," Roberston said. "He is one of those doctors that was cut from the cloth of ... how he felt about people and how he felt about his calling. And so not only is it a shock, it is the ultimate loss for Saint Francis and for Tulsa."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Saint Francis Health System</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Robertson said of his colleagues, "The three best people in the entire world, who are the most committed to doing what they do every day, didn't deserve to die this way."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Ryan Parker, Saint Francis Associate Chief Medical Officer, also expressed her grief and said a prayer for the victims while speaking to reporters on Thursday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I know that all of our colleagues went into medicine to help people. This was their calling," she said, tearing up at times. "This isn't just a career for them. We are supposed to be the ones that are caring for others during tragedies like this. To think that our caregivers were the victims is just incomprehensible to me. They died while serving others. They died in the line of duty."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Slain Patient Possibly Helped Save Lives</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also addressed the family of Love, who was a patient. "To the family of Mr. Love, our hearts break for you," she said. "We so wanted to be able to utilize our skills and training to save these precious lives. To the family of Mr. Love, I'm so sorry we couldn't save you. We are grieving with you."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Police Chief Franklin said Love, a patient at the hospital, acted heroically during the shooting — and that it may have cost him his life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The suspect when he came into the building, into that office complex, he began firing. He began firing at anyone who was in his way. There are reports that one of the victims held a door for someone to allow them to escape out of the back door and was shot and killed," Franklin said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The patient victim held a door closed, I believe is the information I have, to allow someone to escape out of another door," he added later while answering reporters' questions.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Saint Francis Health System</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Husen, whose hospital bio says she practices sports medicine and is an orthopedic surgeon, "was an incredible person," Robertson said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her ex-husband, John Reckenbeil, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told The Washington Post</a> said Husen was "completely genuine" and "the smartest person in the room."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Today our world and our Saint Francis family are devastated," Dr. Parker said at Thursday's press conference. "Our job is to help and heal. And we are here to do our job even if it's with broken hearts."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Saint Francis Health has set up an emergency fund for people who wish to donate.</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Saint Francis Health System is committed to taking care of our own. We are offering services, counseling, pastoral care, pet therapy, EAP services and more to members of our family who need help coping with and processing the tragedies that occurred yesterday," reads a statement on a site set up to accept donations.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We are also committed to supporting the families of our caregivers who were senselessly killed. There has been an outpouring of calls and comments from the community asking how they can offer help to the families of the deceased as well as our employees who are grieving," the statement continues. "A fund has been set up with the Tulsa Community Foundation to accept donations to assist with this cause."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Ontq6xjp2mnKyfp8But8ilo56cXaWutbXEp6tmrKWhwKJ50qGmqKyZo7Rur86lo56Zl6qytHnRnqSepZKav3A%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-carson-rowland-dating.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is Carson Rowland Dating Now</a>
