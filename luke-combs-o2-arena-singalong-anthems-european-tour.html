"It's something that happened naturally. It's not something we particularly set out to do. I write country songs. I'm a country dude from the middle of nowhere in western Virignia. I've always identified as a country band even if it's not top 40 country, it's not that sound, and it's not traditional country, even if there are elements of both of those things within it.</p><p>"We've always been a band that's hard to kind of define; is it Americana? Is it roots? Is it rock? Is it country? We love all kinds of music and I think that shows in the music that we make.</p><p>"We don't run away from any influences. We're able to be completely free with what we create. We make the music that resonates with us and makes us feel great when we're doing it together on stage."</p><p>In an amusing turn of events, the band discovered Luke was a big fan when they spotted that he'd placed an order for a T-shirt from their website.</p><p>He then wore the shirt for a big magazine interview; a public declaration of his love of the band.</p><p>It wasn't long after that they received a call to join Luke on the road, something they jumped at.</p><p>Explaining how the Combs tour has benefited them, he said: "It's massive, particularly here in Europe where we've been doing the tour. We have a headline show on Sunday at Lafayette and it sold out like that [clicks fingers].</p><p>"Being able to put yourself in front of this many eyes and places you've never been before you just get an opportunity every night to make potentially thousands and thousands of new fans so it's definitely increased our profile huge stateside but even more in Europe. People get to see the show, be there in real time and experience it. That's really the best way to discover a band anyway."</p><p>As a result, 49 Winchester have now reached heights they didn't think possible from their humble small town roots.</p><p>"It's pretty mind-blowing, honestly," said Isaac. "We would never have saw ourselves doing this 10 years ago when we started the band.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>"Flash forward a decade and we're playing for 20,000 people in the 02, it's the honour of a lifetime to be on a tour like this and to be playing places that are of this scale and notoriety.
