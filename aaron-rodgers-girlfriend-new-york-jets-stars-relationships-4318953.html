The quarterback — who joined the Green Bay Packers in 2005 and took over the starter QB role in 2008 — has been under the limelight for quite some time, leading to many relationships with many A-listers. From his high-profile relationship with&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Olivia Munn</a>&nbsp;</strong>to his time with&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Danica Patrick</a>&nbsp;</strong>to his short-lived engagement with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Shailene Woodley</strong>,</a> Aaron has quite the dating history to look back on.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>In 2023, Aaron began the next phase of his career, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>signing with the New York Jets.</a> He had announced that he’d play with the team in a March 2023 interview. Unfortunately, the QB may have to sit out the rest of his first season, before it’s even really begun. During the Jets’ season opener against the Buffalo Bills, Aaron tore his left Achilles tendon after getting just four plays in, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>NFL Network.&nbsp;</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aaron-rodgers-girlfriend-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>After the injury, the Jets wished him well and said they were looking forward to a speedy recovery. “Not the way any of us wanted it to go, but we know the commitment you’ve made to this team will continue to impact us moving forward,” the team wrote in a post on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>X</a> (formerly Twitter). “Get well soon.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>So, as he figures out his next step — both on and off the field — here’s a look back at his romantic history.</p><h2>Mallory Edens</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aaron-rodgers-girlfriends-mallory-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>A few months before Aaron announced his plans to play for the Jets, he was rumored to be dating model&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mallory Edens</a>,&nbsp;</strong>per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.&nbsp;Mallory is the daughter of businessman and Milwaukee Bucks co-owner <strong>Wes Edens.&nbsp;</strong>While Mallory and Eden haven’t officially said whether or not they’re dating, she did admit that the QB was close with her dad. “He sits next to us at so many games,” she told “He and my dad are friends.”&nbsp;in November 2019. “He and my dad are friends.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>While they may not be public about whether or not they’re dating, Mallory did reveal that she did get to see him play with the Jets in a preseason game in August 2023. She posted an Instagram Story of herself and a friend sitting in the stands at their match against the New York Giants, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Post.</a></p><h2>Destiny Newton</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Aaron’s first big-time relationship as a famous athlete was with his childhood best friend-turned-lover, <strong>Destiny Newton</strong>. They began to date in 2011, after being “best friends for nine years” and meeting “at church camp,” Destiny’s mom told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Radar Online</a>&nbsp;nearly a decade ago. She added, “They’re very happy together, and our family loves him.” Their love story appeared to end in 2013 when reports of their breakup began surfacing.</p><h2>Jessica Szohr</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Aaron-Rodgers-Exes-AP-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>While this relationship was never confirmed, Aaron was widely believed to have dated <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Gossip Girl</a> star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jessica Szohr</strong></a>, 35. They were first rumored to be together in 2011, and then reportedly “got back together over the holidays” between Dec. 2013-Jan. 2014, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a> claimed.</p><h2>Olivia Munn</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Aaron-Rodgers-Exes-AP-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>One of Aaron’s most famous relationships was with The Predator star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Olivia Munn</strong></a>, 40. They dated for nearly three years, between 2014-2017, but not without some drama. Aaron’s dad, <strong>Ed Rodgers</strong>, revealed that his son had not spoken to their family since 2014 — the same year the NFL star began dating Olivia — saying that “fame can change things” in an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Times</a> published in Jan. 2017.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Olivia had been accused of being one of the reasons this estrangement happened. She finally shot down the rumors while appearing on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Andy </strong></a><b>Cohen’s</b>&nbsp;SiriusXM radio show&nbsp;in May of 2018. “On my last day when I was filming The Newsroom, I spent the day in my trailer just encouraging [Aaron] to, like, have an honest conversation with your parents,” Olivia had recalled. She wanted a reunion to happen — which finally did take place on Aaron’s birthday in Dec. 2018.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>After learning Aaron reunited with his parents, Olivia told TMZ Sports, “Oh my gosh, if that’s true, that’s amazing. It’s long overdue.”</p><h2>Danica Patrick</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Aaron-Rodgers-Exes-AP-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13>Following his romance with Olivia, Aaron didn’t take long to enter another highly-publicized relationship. NASCAR race car driver <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Danica Patrick</strong></a>, 38, confirmed that she was dating Aaron in Jan. 2018 and made their public debut as a couple at the Daytona 500 the next month. They even attended the ESPYS together that year, where the athletes first met in 2012!</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Aaron and Danica’s relationship appeared picture-perfect: they often shared happy couple’s photos and enjoyed romantic getaways together. One of Aaron’s most thoughtful gestures was surprising Danica with a trip to Paris for her 37th birthday in March of 2019 (as you can see above). By Nov. 2019, they had even purchased a $28 million Malibu mansion in cash, per <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>. However, their fairy-tale romance unexpectedly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>came to an end</a> in July 2020, when Danica’s rep confirmed with <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> that they’re “no longer together.”</p><h2>Shailene Woodley</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Aaron-Rodgers-Exes-AP-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-15>Aaron went about his next romance very privately, it seems. Just days after the football star was reportedly in a “long-distance relationship” with Big Little Lies star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Shailene Woodley</strong></a>, 30, he revealed he was “engaged!” While accepting his third MVP Award on the NFL Honors broadcast on Feb. 6, he reflected on the ups and downs of 2020, then saying, “I got engaged.” Toward the end of the speech, he said he wanted to “thank his fiancée” but didn’t name Shailene. Days later, People magazine confirmed that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Shailene was the woman</a> who Aaron had gotten engaged.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Leading up to the initial dating report, which was reported by <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News</a>, Aaron had been staying in Wisconsin for the NFL season (it ended when his Packers team lost the NFC Championship Game at the end of Jan. 2021). Shailene, meanwhile, wasn’t even in the country; she had been filming her new movie Misanthrope&nbsp;in Montreal, Canada. Despite the distance, Aaron and Shailene “have seen each other and been in touch,” the report added. “They continue to talk and see each other when they can. They are both focused on their careers, but they also make time for each other.” Overall, though, the source said that this rumored couple “have kept things private and low key.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>After less than two years together, reports surfaced that the pair had called it a day in February 2022. After rumors that they’d broken up, it was reported that the two had ended things permanently, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>. Despite the breakup, the pair apparently tried to work things out. Shailene was still Aaron’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>date to a wedding</a> he was officiating in March, and a source close to the NFL star told&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>exclusively that he was “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>working on reconciling</a>” with his ex, but the relationship fizzled out once again.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>The pair <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>split up once more</a> in April, and it seems like they’re <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>done for good</a> this time! A source told&nbsp;E! News&nbsp;at the time that they broke up because “everything was on his terms and nothing was going to change.”</p><h2>Rumored Girlfriend</h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>About two months after the split from Shailene, it was reported that Aaron was romantically tied to a new woman named <strong>Blu.&nbsp;</strong>While neither has confirmed their relationship, Blu did take to her social media to address reports which had said her name was “Blu of the Earth” and reported that she was a “witch.” She denied the witch claims and clarified her name, but she didn’t address the rumors that she’s dating Aaron, according to<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;The New York Post</a>.</p><h2>Mallory Edens</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/aaron-rodgers-dating-history-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-20>In the first month of 2023, there were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reports</a> that Aaron had struck up a romance with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Mallory Edens</strong></a>. Mallory (b. 1996) is the daughter of <strong>Wes Edens</strong>, an American billionaire businessman who is co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks and the Premiere League team Aston Villa. Aaron <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>celebrated his 39th birthday</a> with Mallory courtside at a Bucks game, leading to some to speculate about a potential relationship. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a> confirmed that the two were an item.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8CaqaimXae8pbPEq6pmn5mnuae%2ByJ6lnWWemsRuxc6romailanAbr%2FTmqmsZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpcBugJJqb3JtY2Q%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./russell-westbrook.html>&#171;&nbsp;Russell Westbrook Celebrity Profile Hollywood Life</a>
