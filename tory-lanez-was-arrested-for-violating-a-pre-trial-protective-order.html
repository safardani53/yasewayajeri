He wrote in a now-deleted tweet:</p><p>“Breaking: Tory Lanez DNA was NOT discovered on the weapon in the Meg Thee Stallion case, it was disclosed in court a few seconds ago.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Tory-Lanez-3.jpg alt="Tory Lanez" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In a subsequent tweet, the YouTuber said that the official records revealing the shooting’s conclusions were “inconclusive”:</p><p>“I viewed this documentary personally… It explicitly admits that locating Tory DNA on the pistol or magazine was inconclusive.”</p><p>Megan Thee Stallion quickly responded on social media, accusing Akademiks and Lanez of promoting “false narratives” about the matter. At the time, she posted on Instagram:</p><p>“Y’all received breaking news 15 minutes before court began and no one has even been summoned?” You’re trying to win a social media campaign, but this is my actual life! You’re trying to acquire retweets by propagating fake tales!”</p><p>Meanwhile, Lanez entered the internet controversy and reportedly sent Stallion indirect tweets, saying:</p><p>According to Rolling Stone, the rapper reportedly added in a now-deleted tweet, “Ak is saying no falsehoods.” In the most recent hearing, Lanez’s lawyer, Shawn Holley, maintained that her client did not send any information about the case to DJ Akademiks, whose tweet was found to be factually incorrect:</p><p>“What he stated is false. He (DJ Akademiks) said that no DNA was detected on the weapon. In reality, the swab of the gun suggests that there were four donors, which is ‘inconclusive.’ He would have gotten it correctly if he had seen this paper.”</p><p>Holley also referred to the tweets as “chatter in an almost inherently untrustworthy medium.” Meanwhile, Deputy District Attorney Kathy Ta said that Lanez’s reaction to DJ Akademiks’ tweets was part of his goal of “getting ahead and influencing the narrative.”</p><p>Prosecutors allegedly demanded that Tory Lanez be held without bond until his trial or that his bail be set at $5 million. Judge Herriford denied the motion, citing the measures as “excessive.” He did, however, increase Lanez’s bond from $250,000 to $350,000:</p><p>“The court cannot determine that the defendant disseminated anything, but it seems that he breached the injunction barring him from making any remarks about discovery.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Tory-Lanez-2.jpg alt="Tory Lanez" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Lanez was first sentenced to pay $250,000 in bond in August 2021 after breaking his restraining order by playing immediately behind Megan Thee Stallion at the Rolling Loud Festival in Miami.</p><h2>What Happened between Tory Lanez and Megan Thee Stallion?</h2><p>Tory Lanez reportedly shot Megan Thee Stallion in the foot outside a Hollywood Hills house on July 12, 2020, after Kylie Jenner’s party. The Savage hitmaker first claimed she was hurt by shattered glass in her foot but subsequently acknowledged she was a “victim of a gunshot.”</p><p></p><p>She accused Lanez of shooting her during an Instagram live and said that she was afraid to report the event to the police due to the prevailing political issue involving police officers:</p><p>“Of course, this n**** Tory shot me. I wasn’t cut by any glass. I was terrified when the cops arrived because my neighbors had contacted them. All this nonsense with the cops… I didn’t want to perish. I didn’t want the cops to shoot me since there was a n**** in the vehicle with me who had a pistol.”</p><p>During the preliminary hearing in December 2021, Detective Ryan Stogner testified that Lanez allegedly shot Stallion’s feet with a semiautomatic 9mm pistol after leaving Kylie Jenner’s party.&nbsp;Tory Lanez, on the other hand, pleaded not guilty to the accusations in November 2020 and has continued to deny all of them. Following his recent release on bond, the rapper has been ordered not to mention “the complaining witness in this matter on any social media.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKqpYrmiusSzZLCZo2Kus77ErKuenF2bvLN51aKmpZmknruoecBmp6udXam%2Fqq3LZqerp6SasLW11Z5kqKqUmr9w</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-to-play-watermelon-game.html>&#171;&nbsp;Want to Play That 'Tetris'-like Watermelon Game From Japan?
