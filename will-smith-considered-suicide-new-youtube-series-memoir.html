53, aims to lose 20 pounds in 20 weeks.</p><p>The trailer for the YouTube series suggests the journey opened the Aladdin actor's eyes to so much more.</p><p>In a voice over, Will says: "This began as a journey to get into the best shape of my life.</p><p>"When I started this show, I thought I was getting into the best shape of my life physically. But mentally I was somewhere else.</p><p>"I ended up discovering a whole lot of hidden things about myself."</p><p>The trailer shows the Fresh Prince of Bel Air star working on his upcoming memoir.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><h2>CANDID CONFESSION</h2><p>While sitting around a table with children Trey, 28, Willow, 20, and Jaden, 23.</p><p>Will reveals to them: "That was the only time in my life that I ever considered suicide."</p><p>Willow appears emotional, while her brothers and others at the table look on quietly.</p><p>It's unclear when in Will's life he's referring to.</p><p>He appeared emotional in another portion of the trailer, sitting around the same table.</p><p>Will used a tissue to dry his tears, while Willow looked on crying and wiping her own face.</p><h2>SEX LIFE STRIFE</h2><p>Will's emotional confession about his mental health woes comes after wife Jada Pinkett-Smith opened up about <a href=#>her bedroom struggles</a> with the actor.</p><p>During an episode of Red Table Talk, Jada told Goop founder Gwyneth Paltrow that she struggles with not getting what she "wants" sexually from Will. She also admitted she struggles to know what she likes sometimes.</p><p>She revealed: "It's hard.</p><p>"The thing Will and I talk about a lot is the journey. We started in this at a very young age, you know, 22 years old.</p><p>"That's why the accountability part really hit for me because I think you expect your partner to know [what you need], especially when it comes to sex."</p><p>She continued: "It's like, 'Well, if you love me, you should know. If you love me, you should read my mind.' That's a huge pitfall."</p><p>Jada, 50, came under fire from fans who suggested she stop putting Will down and sharing the ugly parts of their romance.</p><p>One social media user wrote: "Why Jada dissing Will like that."</p><p>Another tweeted: "Everything I know about Jada & Will's marriage I learned without my consent."</p><h2>ENTANGLED OR NOT?</h2><p>Will and Jada have been married for more than two decades.</p><p>During that time, rumors have swirled about both being linked to other stars.</p><p>The couple have <a href=#>denied being unfaithful</a> at any point throughout their marriage.</p><p>In 2020, however, Jada admitted to having an "entanglement" with rapper August Alsina.</p><p>The relationship took place in 2017 during "a difficult time" in her marriage to Will.</p><p>Jada claimed they had "basically broken up."</p><p>She revealed of her relationship with August: "As time went on, I got into a different type of entanglement with August."</p><p>During the episode, Will confessed that he and Jada had been separated for a "period of time."</p><p>He added: "I was done with you."</p><p>Will later revealed that he and Jada have an open marriage and had explored polygamy.</p><p>The reveal came after Jada discussed her romance with the younger rapper on Red Table Talk.</p><h2>LADIES MAN</h2><p>Evidently, Will has always had unconventional ideas of romance and relationships.</p><p>He previously admitted that he dreamed of dating several famous women at the same time when he was a teen.</p><p>Will told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GQ</a>: "The idea of travelling with 20 women that I loved and took care of and all of that, it seemed like a really great idea."</p><p>Women on the list included Halle Berry and Misty Copeland, a famous American ballerina.</p><p>Will admitted he felt shame for dreaming about polygamy, which he chalked up to his "Christian upbringing."</p><h2>UNCONVENTIONAL COUPLE</h2><p>During the same interview, Will revealed that because of her upbringing, Jada "never believed in a conventional marriage."</p><p>He told the magazine: "Jada had family members that had an unconventional relationship... so she grew up in a way that was very different then how I grew up."</p><p>Jada seemingly gave Will the go-ahead to cheat in a 2013 interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HuffPost</a>.</p><p>She told the outlet: "I've always told Will, 'You can do whatever you want a long as you can look at yourself in the mirror and be okay'.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"I'm here as his partner, but he is his own man. He has to decide who he wants to be and that's not for me to do for him. Or vice versa."</p><p>She later confirmed via Facebook: "Will and I BOTH can do WHATEVER we want, because we TRUST each other to do so. This does NOT mean we have an open relationship... this means we have a GROWN one."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000690081822-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000690081821.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000690081814.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Will Smith reveals he 'considered suicide' when he had to 'expose his life' in new YouTube docu-series and upcoming memoir</span><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWiblaGyo77IraCeq19mg3aEj29pbWennrmtedKmoK2gXZi8r7%2FInZyrnZRiwLa1wqKbnmWemsRuxc6uq66alWLApr7InqpmpZWivKq%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./wwe-nikki-bella-strips-naked-john-cena.html>&#171;&nbsp;WWE star Nikki Bella strips naked to celebrate 500,000 YouTube subscribers with John Cena</a>
