People born in the Year of the Monkey pursue interests. If it's something they don't particularly enjoy, they'll sloppily complete the task. If it's something they're passionate about, they'll labor tirelessly until they achieve it. They have a long life full of vitality and wonder about the world. Relationships are important to monkeys as well. However, pampering children may be one of their flaws.</p><p>People born on March 11 have a zodiac sign of <strong>Pisces</strong>. There would almost certainly be an image of Pisces next to the term "psychic" in the dictionary. Pisces is the zodiac's most perceptive, sensitive, and empathic sign, and that's because it's the last of the last. Pisces, as the final sign, has absorbed every lesson taught by the preceding signs, including the pleasures and sorrows, hopes and anxieties. It is represented as two fish swimming in opposite directions, symbolizing Pisces' continual divide of attention between imagination and reality.</p><p>Younger brother of singer-songwriter Taylor Swift who became a freelance photographer for Getty Images.
