Had A Break Up</h1><div id=sub-header>June 2024 · 5 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p>American singer Mackenzie Ziegler and her longtime boyfriend Tacoda Dubbs recently appear to have parted ways.</p><p>On November 9, 2023, the official TikTok Room page shared a screenshot of a message from an insider, providing insights that indicated a possible breakup between Ziegler and Dubbs.</p><p>In the screenshot, the person revealed that the singer took down the anniversary post and went a step further by removing the picture she had of Dubbs from her phone case.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, it was noted that both Ziegler and Dubbs deleted all their shared Instagram posts, hinting at a significant change in their relationship status.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Upon the revelation, a wave of emotions swept through the comment section. Expressing a mix of surprise and concern, one fan reflected, “Oh, now this is tea for me because I remember when they first started dating. What’s going on? What’s happening?”&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, another follower added a note of sorrow, stating, “This is so sad. They were together for over 3 years. Hope they are doing okay.”&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, following the news of Ziegler and Dubbs parting ways, the singer was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spotted</a> with Johnny Orlando, as reported by TMZ.</p><p>Despite the clear signs of a breakup evident in their online activities, Ziegler and her boyfriend, have not issued an official statement confirming the end of their relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, they still follow each other on Instagram. Therefore, until the couple themselves confirm their breakup, the status of their relationship remains unverified.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mackenzie Ziegler and Tacoda Dubbs’ relationship timeline&nbsp;</h2><p>Ziegler and Dubbs’s love story has a cute beginning. The singer’s sister, Maddie, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">found</a> Dubbs on TikTok and thought he was cute, so she sent Ziegler a video of him, suggesting they should chat.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking her sister’s advice, Ziegler messaged Dubbs, and their conversations quickly turned into regular FaceTime calls. Despite being physically apart, their connection grew stronger during these virtual dates. Eventually, they decided to meet in person and officially started their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">romantic</a> journey around 2020.</p><p>In June 2021, Dubbs expressed his affection for Kenzie by posting a heartfelt birthday message on Instagram and captioned, “Happy birthday day, princess.” In response, the singer reciprocated the love by commenting, “I love u so much.”&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, the duo commemorated their 11-month anniversary in July 2021 with a heartwarming celebration showcased through a collection of romantic photos featuring tender kisses and heartfelt expressions of love.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/dated-3.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Mackenzie Ziegler and Tacoda Dubbs share an adorable love story. (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GettyImages</a>)</p><p>Along with the post, the singer captioned, “Best 11 months w u.” Dubbs, for his part, didn’t add a caption on his Instagram but Ziegler left a romantic comment reading, “My baby, I love u.”</p><p>In 2022, she also offered a glimpse into her relationship with her boyfriend by sharing a captivating picture of them during a beach trip. The photo captured a tender moment, with Ziegler’s hands wrapped around Dubbs’ waist, illustrating their closeness and shared enjoyment of the beach outing.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, their social media presence continued to radiate affection, featuring numerous displays of public displays of affection (PDA) and intimacy. Ziegler also found inspiration in her relationship with Tacoda, leading her to pen the heartfelt song “Happy for Me.”&nbsp;</p><p>Opening up about her journey, the singer revealed that achieving true happiness and a healthy relationship took time. However, with Tacoda, she discovered a partner who embraces her for who she is, allowing her to find happiness within herself.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, Ziegler isn’t the sole admirer of her boyfriend; she disclosed that her boyfriend has garnered affection not only from her but also from friends, family, and fans alike.&nbsp;</p><p>Initially, the singer expressed reservations about making her relationship public, fearing the potential scrutiny. However, she was pleasantly surprised by the overwhelmingly positive feedback she received from her millions of fans once she decided to share this aspect of her life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mackenzie Ziegler was previously in a relationship with Isaak Presley</h2><p>Rumors of Ziegler and Presley’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">romantic</a> involvement first began circulating in August 2019, gaining traction as the duo started sharing joint content on various social media platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>Several months later, the speculation took a more definitive turn when Isaak uploaded the “Girlfriend Tag” on YouTube. This video not only provided a closer look into their relationship but also served as a public confirmation of their romantic connection.&nbsp;</p><p>After sharing a relationship for nearly a year, rumors <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">surfaced</a> in March 2020 suggesting that Isaak had been unfaithful to the singer. Ziegler swiftly addressed the speculation, staunchly refuting the cheating allegations with a firm statement, declaring, “All of these girls are trying to say Isaak cheated on me when he was with me every day.”&nbsp;</p><p>However, despite her initial denial, the narrative took a turn in May 2020 when Ziegler, in an Instagram Live session, openly shared with her fans that she and Isaak had indeed decided to part ways.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/dated-4.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Mackenzie Ziegler and Isaak Presley were in a relationship for approximately one year. (Source: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sportskeeda</a>)</p><p>She said, “I’ve been seeing a lot of comments asking if Isaak and I are together, just because right now we are not together. I had to act like we were OK because I didn’t want you guys to hate on him or anything. He didn’t do anything, I didn’t do anything, we’re just both not in a good mental state right now.”</p><p>The singer added, “We just decided to be friends right now. It’s super hard because I love him a lot. I hope it’ll get better and that we’re both going to be OK but we can’t be together right now.”</p><p>Likewise, Isaak took to YouTube to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">address</a> the split and the infidelity allegations. Expressing nothing but love for Ziegler, he emphasized that he had not a single negative thing to say about their relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>He urged viewers not to jump to conclusions, explaining that breakups often result from factors beyond personal animosity, such as timing or circumstances beyond control. Dismissing the cheating allegations, he stressed that outsiders only see a limited layer of reality and may not know the full story behind the situation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57zZ6urGedlrCssc2zoJ5lqp6yqLjEq2Sbp6mbv6qxzZ1km6qVlrhuwc9o</p></div><div id=links><a href=./eastenders-spoilers-mick-shock-return-christmas-linda.html>&#171;&nbsp;Mick Carter makes surprise return in fresh Christmas blow for Linda in EastEnders</a>
