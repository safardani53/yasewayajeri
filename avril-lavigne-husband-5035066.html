Immediately,” she gushed at the time. “He made every day better. It was like I had known him forever. As time went on, things kept getting better, and it felt incredibly natural.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Soon after that, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mod</a> popped the question and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>got engaged</a> to Avril in March 2022.

I’ll keep my head up + always listen to my heart, even when it feels broken,” his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>lengthy caption</a> read on Tuesday. “Being surrounded by love every night on tour has been an absolute blessing.
